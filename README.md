# code_for_good

This project has the goal of improving a user's finances and sustainability whilst grocery shopping. In a fun game-like setting it allows a user to input their shopping list, suggests alternative items that are better financially or emissions-wise, calculates the total savings and displays it to them.


Our emissions data was sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-kg-poore and our price data was sourced from https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/shoppingpricescomparisontool/2023-05-03
